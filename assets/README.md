# Assets Folder

This folder is for static assets that are not part of the frontend build.

## Purpose

Use this folder for:
- Documentation files (PDFs, images)
- Logos and branding assets
- Backup files
- Migration scripts
- Other static resources

## Note

Frontend assets (images, fonts, etc.) should go in `frontend/public/` or `frontend/src/assets/` to be included in the build process.
